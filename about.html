            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I was born on December 12, 1992, in Cali, Colombia, and have spent my career developing and honing my skills in a range of software development positions. My passion for game development and my expertise in languages such as C++ and C# have equipped me to work on exciting and innovative projects in the gaming industry.</p>

            <p>My journey started as a Front End Developer at EXISTA YA, where I developed my expertise in web development, crafting dynamic and visually appealing websites. I then transitioned to game development roles at TNT3 Studio and Digital Virgo where I developed several mobile and web games.</p>
                
            <p>At ParqueSoft, as a Lead Developer, I took my passion for game development further by working on a project which utilized the Unity Engine and AI. Later at GLOBANT and Unity Pereira, I delved deeper into game engine development, working with C++ and supporting multiple render pipelines. Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft, where I develop and maintain key features for the Outlook Calendar.</p>
                
            <p>My technical skills include proficiency in English and Spanish, expertise in C++, C#, JavaScript, expertise in Unity Engine and understanding of rendering APIs such as DirectX, Metal, Vulkan, and OpenGL.</p>
                
            <p>I'm currently pursuing Systems Engineering at Universidad Areandina. When I'm not coding, I'm likely engaging with the gaming community or exploring the latest industry trends.</p>
